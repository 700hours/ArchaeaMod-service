[i]Features implemented are a few such as these:[/i]
* Progression-based difficulty mode
* 1 new biome
* 3 new structures
* Many items and enemies
* Complimentary to vanilla
* Pre-hardmode completion step with hint

There are several key binds that do things like prompt show/hide UI. 

The status dialog is drag-able--click and hold anywhere on it to move it around.

[hr]
Progression requirements are made clear in the mod, and the gear and items found will assist in the general completion of the vanilla game.

A particular inclusion is a mode which revises damage and health statistics along with a checklist, each item adding to the difficulty.

Multiplayer gameplay is included. Dedicated server usage is also implemented.
